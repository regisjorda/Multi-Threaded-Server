    <br>
    In this assignment you are going to create a functional single
    threaded web server in the programming or scripting language of your
    choice (C or C++ recommended as you can then use the skeleton
    program linked to the bottom of this document). Your program will be
    capable of serving web pages to a browser such as Firefox, and
    compliant with HTTP/1.0 as defined by <a
      href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1945.html">RFC 1945</a>.<br>
    <br>
    In this web server you must implement GET, HEAD, and POST methods of
    HTTP, and also your program must support text/plain and text/html
    content types. For POST, creation of a file on the server will
    suffice.<br>
    <br>
    The following response codes must be implemented by your server
    program:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 200 (OK),<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 201 (File created successfully - POST),<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 400 (bad requests such as no leading / on path,
    HTTP/2.0+, no Content-Length for POST),<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 403 (no read permissions),<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 404 (file does not exist),<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 501 (not implemented - ie not GET, HEAD, or
    POST methods that implemented in your program).<br>
    <br>
    This web server will take a configuration file, <a
      href="myhttpd.conf">myhttpd.conf</a>, of the following format:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HTTP1.0 [root]<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HTML html htm<br>
    where root is the document root, for example /var/www/html is the
    default directory for Apache on Linux. The other line defines file
    extensions for the file type of HTML which will be used in the
    server response.<br>
    <br>
    Your server program requires following Command-line arguments.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -p [port]<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specify port number to listen
    on<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -d<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print additional debugging
    information. Not specifically required, but this may be used to
    demonstrate PARTIAL functionality in the event that the server is
    not entirely functional.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Information:</span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Servers</span>:
    Your program should be runnable on any of <span style="font-style:
      italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>the&nbsp;<span
      style="font-style: italic;"> </span>linux<span style="font-style:
      italic;"> </span>nodes <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
    which are given by <span style="font-style: italic;">moon.scs.ryerson.ca

    </span>department of computer science linux servers.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ports</span>:
    if you are testing this system on a shared server such as <span
      style="font-style: italic;">leda</span>, be aware that particular
    ports may be unavailable (either in use by other users, or blocked
    by the system administrator). On a Linux server, only ports ABOVE
    60000 may be used by normal users, those up to and including 59999
    are reserved. The maximum port number is 65535.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IMPORTANT: For testing, use port number 6xxxx,
    where xxxx are the last 4 digits of your student number. If the last
    4 digits are 5536 or greater, subtract 5000.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IMPORTANT: REMEMBER TO KILL YOUR PROCESS TO CLOSE
    YOUR PORT WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED WITH IT!!!<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Testing</span>:
    the telnet command is very useful for testing your web server. Try
    connecting to any web server, such as redhat.com by issuing this<br>
    command;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; telnet www.redhat.com 80<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where 80 is the port number (standard for web
    servers). When you have connected, try issuing a simple GET
    command,as the following;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GET / HTTP/1.0 . For example:
    &nbsp; GET /index.htm HTTP/1.0&nbsp; requesting index.htm <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For HEAD, the format is almost identical (HEAD
    /indexi.htm HTTP/1.0) , except it uses HEAD keyword instead of GET.
    POST is slightly more complicated because the header must include
    the length of the data being sent. For that reason you should add
    Content-Length header as the following for POST :<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POST /filename HTTP/1.0<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Content-Length:
    decimal-size-in-bytes<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; note: follow the header that is shown above,
    press Enter TWICE to inform the server that it has received the
    entire header. For a POST, after the header, press Enter twice, then
    input the same number of bytes (text) to be sent as specified in the
    header, then press Enter again to send.<br>
    <br>
    You can begin working with this <a href="myhttpd.c">skeleton
      program</a>.<br>
    What you must add to this program is the ability to process the
    specified command-line arguments, the configuration file, and
    methods to process and serve the client requests.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Submission:</span>
    The completed programs (source code, not executable) must be emailed
    to cps730@scs.ryerson.ca&nbsp; from your ryerson email address
    before your lab hours in Wednesdays of Sept. 19 and Sept. 26 for the
    parts that are mentioned in the marking form for assignment 1.&nbsp;
    Please use "CPS730 assignment1" as the subject of your email. Then
    at the lab , you will demonstrate your server program functionality,
    and TA will mark your assignment according to the marking form and
    marking schema posted on the course web page.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hint:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;


    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Test&nbsp;
your


    server and client programs on one available host&nbsp; for
    simplicity (for example: leda). Make sure you have already wrote the
    host IP address in your program and complied version of your server
    knows the host IP address otherwise you will get "bind: Cannot
    assign requested address" error. &nbsp; &nbsp; <span
